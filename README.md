After a long time i come back to my web development journry with programming hero. This is my programming hero's assignment projects.
I don't know, how to write readme file properly.
This is a educational website. I make this project by helping a website. I just take idea from this website.
I use here Tailwind CSS. Tailwind is awesome for managing huge utilites.
For time shortage, i haven't focus everthing ins and out this project.
I have to Submit 5 Assignment within 3 days. This is very challenging to me.
By the i can't write details about this project now.
Later i will update readme.
